// Identifiers returns information about a resource's identifying fields and
// those fields' values.
type Identifiers interface {
	// Fields returns an ordered slice of slices of Fields that contain values
	// that can be used to uniquely identify the resource.
	//
	// The returned slice is sorted by efficiency of fetch operation. For
	// example, assume an S3 Bucket resource. It may be identified by ARN or by
	// Bucket Location in addition to the Bucket's Name field, which happens to
	// be globally-unique, so the returned value from Fields() would be:
	//
	// [][]Field{
	//   {Field("ARN")},
	//   {Field("Location")},
	//   {Field("Name")},
	// }
	//
	// For something like an RDS DBInstance, the DB instance's ARN is a
	// globally unique identifier, but the instance's DBInstanceIdentifier
	// field is only unique when coupled with the customer's AWS Account and
	// Region. So, the returned value from Fields() would be:
	//
	// [][]Field{
	//   {Field("ARN")},
	//   {Field("DBInstanceIdentifier"), Field("CloudAccountID"), Field("CloudRegion")},
	// }
	Fields() [][]Field
